# PC-Screen-Recod-and-Save-Machine-Learning
This project involves creating a screen recording application using Python. The application captures a specified region of the screen and saves it as a video file. Users can select the screen area to record and set the desired frames per second (FPS) for the video. The recording continues until the user stops it by pressing the 'q' key.
